Paper - Activation Functions in Neural Networks

Abstract -
The Backpropagation algorithm allows multilayer feed forward neural networks to learn input/output mappings from training observations. Backpropagation in neural networks adapt themselves to learn the relationship between the set of example patterns that could be leveraged to apply the same relationship to new input patterns. The network is able to focus on the features of an arbitrary input. The activation function is used to transform the activation level of a unit (neuron) into an output signal. There are a number of common activation functions in use with artificial neural networks (ANN). This paper aims to perform analysis of the different activation functions and provide a benchmark of it. The purpose is to figure out the optimal activation function for the problem of predicting flight delays or no delyas for Hawaiin Airflights. This further intends to help in better planning and control of disruption management.
